          <p>In some way, you have probably heard about a band called BTS. If you have, you probably saw them performing on the American Music Awards or presenting at the Grammy's. Maybe you saw them performing at the Billboard Music Awards and winning Top Social Artist and Top Duo/Group. Maybe you heard about them selling out stadiums worldwide or you just heard about their "crazy" fans. Or maybe you've never heard abotu them because you live under a rock but hey, at least you're reading this website. So I am here to help introduce you to the most popular bouy band on the PLANET.</p>
