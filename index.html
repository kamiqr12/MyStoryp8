          <p>In some way, you have probably heard about a band called BTS. If you have, you probably saw them performing on the American Music Awards or presenting at the Grammy's. Maybe you saw them performing at the Billboard Music Awards and winning Top Social Artist and Top Duo/Group. Maybe you heard about them selling out stadiums worldwide or you just heard about their "crazy" fans. Or maybe you've never heard abotu them because you live under a rock but hey, at least you're reading this website. So I am here to help introduce you to the most popular boy band on the PLANET.</p>

	  <h3>WHO ARE BTS?</h3>
	  <p>BTS are a South Korean boy band made up of 7 members. They debuted in June 2013 as the only artist signed under Bighit Entertainment, which was a relatively small company at the time (The company is now worth $57 million USD.) The 7 members, from youngest to oldest, are known as Jungkook (21), V (23), Jimin (23), RM (24), J-Hope (25), Suga (26) and Jin (26). BTS stands for Beyond the Scene and their fandom is known as the ARMY.</p>
	  <p> Since their debut in 2013, they have written and officially released 207 songs, but have released music on the side on their Soundcloud. They have also collaborated with other artists such as Fall Out Boy, Wale, Steve Aoki, Ed Sheeran, and Charlie XCX. Right now, they are completing the Japanese leg of their sold out Speak Yourself stadium tour. The tour kicked off on May 4 with a show in LA at Rosebowl Stadium before making stops in Chicago (Soldier Field) and New Jersey (Metlife). Other stops included Brazil (Allianz Parque) and London (Wembley) before finishing off in Paris at the Stade de France. Every stop sold out in 2 hours or less after tickets went on sale.</p>
	  <p> The impact BTS has had on the music scene is remarkable. They have redefined what a boy band is and have used their influence for good.</p>
